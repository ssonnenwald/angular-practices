<h1>Facade Pattern</h1>
<div class="mb-4">
  The <b>Facade Pattern</b> is a structural design pattern that provides a
  simplified interface to a complex system of classes or
  subsystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;It acts as a "wrapper" to simplify the interactions for
  the end user, hiding the complexities of the underlying system.
</div>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<div class="mb-4">
  In the context of <b>Angular 19</b> with <b>standalone components</b>, let's
  create a scenario where we have a <b>complex subsystem</b> involving multiple
  services, and we want to simplify the interaction by creating a
  <b>Facade</b> service that abstracts away the complexity.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Subsystem Services (Simulating Complex Logic)</b>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="mb-4">
    Let’s define several services that represent different parts of the system,
    each having a distinct responsibility.
  </div>

  <app-code-highlight
    [code]="facadePatternCode1"
    [language]="'typescript'"
  ></app-code-highlight>

  <app-code-highlight
    [code]="facadePatternCode2"
    [language]="'typescript'"
  ></app-code-highlight>

  <app-code-highlight
    [code]="facadePatternCode3"
    [language]="'typescript'"
  ></app-code-highlight>

  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      <b>Facade Service (Simplifying the Interface)</b>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="mb-4">
    We now create the <b>Facade Service</b>, which will use the above subsystem
    services but offer a simpler API to the user.
  </div>

  <app-code-highlight
    [code]="facadePatternCode4"
    [language]="'typescript'"
  ></app-code-highlight>

  <ol start="3">
    <li><b>Standalone Component (Using the Facade)</b></li>
  </ol>
  <div class="mb-4">
    Now, let’s create a <b>standalone Angular</b> component that uses the Facade
    service to interact with the subsystem in a simplified way.
  </div>

  <app-code-highlight
    [code]="facadePatternCode5"
    [language]="'typescript'"
  ></app-code-highlight>
</div>

<h4 class="mt-4">Explanation:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Subsystem Services</b> (<span class="hljs-attr"
      >AuthenticationService</span
    >, <span class="hljs-attr">ProfileService</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">NotificationService</span>):&nbsp;&nbsp;These
    represent different, unrelated parts of the system, each handling specific
    tasks (e.g., login, profile management, notifications).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Facade Service</b> (<span class="hljs-attr">UserFacadeService</span
    >):&nbsp;&nbsp;This service abstracts the complexity of interacting with
    multiple services by providing a simpler API (<span class="hljs-attr"
      >loginAndUpdateProfile</span
    >, <span class="hljs-attr">logoutAndNotify</span>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>AppComponent</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In this component, we interact with the
    <span class="hljs-attr">UserFacadeService</span> instead of directly
    interacting with each subsystem service, simplifying the logic and making
    the code cleaner.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-4">Conclusion:</h4>
<div class="mb-4">
  The <b>Facade Pattern</b> in Angular 19 with standalone components simplifies
  the interaction with a complex system of services by providing a unified and
  simpler interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example, instead of calling multiple
  services directly (which might involve more complicated logic), the component
  interacts only with the facade, making the code cleaner and easier to
  maintain.
