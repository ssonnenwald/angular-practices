<h1>L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h1>

<div class="mb-4 mt-2">
  <h6>Original Definition</h6>
  If <span class="hljs-attr">S</span> is a subtype of
  <span class="hljs-attr">T</span>, then objects of type
  <span class="hljs-attr">T</span> in a program may be replaced with objects of
  type <span class="hljs-attr">S</span> without altering any of the desirable
  properties of that program.<br /><br />

  <h6>Simple Definition</h6>
  The LSP says that if you have a class, you should be able to use any of its
  subclasses interchangeably without breaking the program.
</div>

<h5>Example</h5>

In the initial example, we have an
<span class="hljs-attr">ImageProcessor</span> class responsible for various
image processing operations such as
<b
  >compression, enhancing size, removing background, and enhancing quality with
  AI</b
>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's also a
<span class="hljs-attr">LimitedImageProcessor</span> class that extends
<span class="hljs-attr">ImageProcessor</span>, but it overrides the
<span class="hljs-attr">removeBackground</span> and
<span class="hljs-attr">enhanceQualityWithAI</span> methods to throw errors
indicating that these features are only available in the premium version.<br /><br />

This violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because substituting an instance
of <span class="hljs-attr">LimitedImageProcessor</span> for an instance of
<span class="hljs-attr">ImageProcessor</span> could lead to unexpected errors if
code relies on those overridden methods.<br /><br />

To adhere to the LSP, we refactor the classes. We create a
<span class="hljs-attr">PremiumImageProcessor</span> class that extends
<span class="hljs-attr">ImageProcessor</span> and implements the
removeBackground and enhanceQualityWithAI methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, both
classes share a common interface and substituting an instance of
<span class="hljs-attr">PremiumImageProcessor</span> for an instance of
<span class="hljs-attr">ImageProcessor</span> won't break the program's
correctness.<br /><br />

In the refactored version, <span class="hljs-attr">ImageProcessor</span> is now
focused on basic image processing operations like compression and enhancing
size, while <span class="hljs-attr">PremiumImageProcessor</span> extends it to
include premium features like removing background and enhancing quality with
AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;This separation allows for better code organization and adherence
to the Liskov Substitution Principle.<br /><br />
