<h1>Singleton Pattern</h1>
<div class="mb-4">
  Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object
  of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other
  code.
</div>

<h2>Singleton Service</h2>
<div class="mb-4">
  Here’s an example of a singleton service in Angular 19 using TypeScript:
  <ol>
    <li>Creating the Singleton Service</li>
  </ol>
  <div>
    In Angular, the service can still be provided at the root level to ensure
    that it follows the Singleton pattern.
  </div>
</div>

<app-code-highlight
  [code]="singletonPatternCode1"
  [language]="'typescript'"
></app-code-highlight>

<h4 class="mt-4">Key Points:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    providedIn: 'root' ensures that the service is a singleton throughout the
    application (Angular will create it only once).
  </li>
  <li>
    The getInstance() method ensures that only one instance of the service is
    ever created.
  </li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Using the Singleton Service in a Component</li>
</ol>

<div class="mb-4">
  To use the singleton service in a component, you simply inject the service as
  usual. Angular ensures it’s the same instance throughout the application.
</div>

<app-code-highlight
  [code]="singletonPatternCode2"
  [language]="'typescript'"
></app-code-highlight>

<h4 class="mt-4">Explanation:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the service, getInstance() controls the creation of the singleton
    instance. If the instance doesn’t exist, it is created, otherwise the
    existing one is returned.
  </li>
  <li>
    The component injects the SingletonService, and you can use its getData()
    method or any other methods you define.
  </li>
</ul>
