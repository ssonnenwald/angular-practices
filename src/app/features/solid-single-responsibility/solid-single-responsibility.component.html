<h1>S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h1>

<div class="mb-4 mt-2">
  <h6>Original Definition</h6>
  There should never be more than one reason for a class to
  change.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every class should have only one responsibility.<br /><br />

  <h6>Simple Definition</h6>
  SRP means that each class should only be responsible for one
  thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It keeps classes focused and makes code easier to understand
  and maintain.

<h5>Example</h5>

Before following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), the Profile class
was handling both user profile data (like email, bio, etc.) and user settings
(theme and preferredLanguage).&nbsp;&nbsp;This violated SRP because a class
should have only one reason to change, but here the Profile class had multiple
reasons to change - if either the profile data structure or the settings
structure changed.<br /><br />

After following SRP, the code was refactored to separate
concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Profile class now only deals with profile-related
information such as email and bio.&nbsp;&nbsp;The settings-related functionality
has been moved to a new Settings class.&nbsp;&nbsp;This change improves
maintainability and makes the codebase more flexible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if there's
a need to update how settings are handled, it only affects the Settings class,
keeping the Profile class untouched. Additionally, it enhances code readability
and makes it easier to understand the purpose of each class.<br /><br />
